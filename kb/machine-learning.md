# Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.

## Key Concepts

- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled training data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in data without labels  
- **Neural Networks**: Computational models inspired by biological neural networks
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks with multiple layers

## Popular Algorithms

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machines
5. k-Means Clustering
